# BioGlow
*Capturing biological Ultra-Weak Photon Emission*

**Foundry Scientist:** Aeron T Hammack

**Super User:** Rhys Mould

## Science

All cells spontaneously release extremely low levels of light, a phenomenon known as Ultra-Weak Photon Emission (UPE). These photons are byproducts of excited Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), themselves byproducts of cellular metabolism. As such, the intensity of emission is tied to the cellâ€™s metabolic state, meaning UPE could facilitate previously unknown light-based signalling pathways. However, study of UPE is made challenging because of the low intensities: 1--1000 photons per second per cm<sup>2</sup>. 

## Hardware

The BioGlow system, pictured, is designed to capture and study the UPE phenomena in detail. Contained with a dark box to prevent exogenous light interference (left image), the BioGlow is a programmable, automated system consisting of two Peltier-cooled low dark count PMTs (right image) to measure both total photon output and spectrally resolved emission. An automated stage allows multiple samples to be analysed in a single experiment. A MultiHarp time correlated single photon counter also provides time tagging photon arrival, enabling users to investigate potential photon bunching, which may imply quantum phenomena occurring within a biological system. Wavelength filtering with Bandpass filters on PMT A allow for spectrally-resolved measurements of UPE.

## Experiment Types 

### MultiHarp Channel Optimizer

`multiharp_channel_optimizer`

ScopeFoundry measurement to visualize count rates

### MultiHarp T2


### BioGlow Spectral Collection

`bioglow_spec`

Loops through up to 4 sample positions, 11 spectral windows and collects photons on both PMTs for a set amount of time for each sample and spectral "block". Output file is an HDF5 file that stores both time-stamped count rates  as well as raw MultiHarp T2 style photon event records for each block. Each block is addtionally saved as its own HDF5 file for backup.

## Processing and Analysis

### BioGlow Spectral datasets in Crucible

`bioglow_spec` datasets are automatically ingested into [Crucible](https://crucible.lbl.gov) and can be viewed on [SciCat](https://mf-scicat.lbl.gov) or accessed via Google Drive.

### Jupyter Notebooks for Count rate analysis

Coming Soon!
