## Hardware

The uncorrected FEI TitanX 60-300 microscope at NCEM is equipped to do fast energy dispersive X-ray mapping (EDS), 4D-STEM, S/ TEM imaging and tomography.  All TEM holders that are compatible with FEI microscopes can be used for heating, cooling and other in-situ experiments. The ability to switch between 60, 80, 120, 200, and 300kV during one TEM session gives the user flexibility to optimize experimental conditions â€“ balancing sample damage, spatial resolution, and signal-to-noise.
